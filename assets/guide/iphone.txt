00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,160
This is a day I’ve been looking forward to for two and a half years.
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:27,760
Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything.
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,480
And Apple has been, well, first of all, one’s very fortunate if you get to work on just
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,000
one of these in your career.
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,200
Apple’s been very fortunate.
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,040
It’s been able to introduce a few of these into the world.
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,960
In 1984, we introduced the Macintosh.
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,120
It didn’t just change Apple.
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:06,400
It changed the whole computer industry.
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,400
In 2001, we introduced the first iPod.
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,200
And it didn’t just change the way we all listen to music.
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,720
It changed the entire music industry.
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:35,880
Well, today, we’re introducing three revolutionary products of this class.
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:52,920
The first one is a widescreen iPod with touch controls.
00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:07,960
The second is a revolutionary mobile phone.
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:15,920
And the third is a breakthrough internet communications device.
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,440
So, three things.
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,720
A widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,720
internet communications device.
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:39,840
An iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator.
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,840
An iPod, a phone.
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:50,200
Are you getting it?
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,200
These are not three separate devices.
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,200
This is one device.
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:05,840
And we are calling it iPhone.
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,840
Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,840
And here it is.
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,840
No.
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,840
Actually, here it is, but we’re going to leave it there for now.
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:35,840
So, before we get into it, let me talk about a category of things.
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,840
The most advanced phones are called smartphones, so they say.
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,840
And they typically combine a phone plus some email capability, plus they say it’s the internet,
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,840
sort of the baby internet, into one device.
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,840
And they all have these plastic little keyboards on them.
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,840
And the problem is that they’re not so smart and they’re not so easy to use.
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,840
So, if you kind of make a business school 101 graph of the smart axis and the easy to use axis,
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
phones, regular cell phones are kind of right there.
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,840
They’re not so smart and they’re not so easy to use.
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,840
But smartphones are definitely a little smarter, but they actually are harder to use.
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,840
They’re really complicated.
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,840
Just for the basic stuff, people have a hard time figuring out how to use them.
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,840
Well, we don’t want to do either one of these things.
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:36,840
What we want to do is make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,840
and super easy to use.
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,840
This is what iPhone is.
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,840
So, we’re going to reinvent the phone.
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:56,840
We’re going to start with a revolutionary user interface.
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,840
It is the result of years of research and development.
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,840
And, of course, it’s an interplay of hardware and software.
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,840
Now, why do we need a revolutionary user interface?
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,840
I mean, here’s four smartphones, right?
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,840
Motorola Q, the Blackberry, Palm Treo, Nokia E62, the usual suspects.
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,840
And what’s wrong with their user interfaces?
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Well, the problem with them is really sort of in the bottom 40 there.
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,840
It’s this stuff right here.
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,840
They all have these keyboards that are there whether you need them or not to be there.
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:39,840
And they all have these control buttons that are fixed in plastic and are the same for every application.
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,840
Well, every application wants a slightly different user interface,
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,840
a slightly optimized set of buttons just for it.
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,840
And what happens if you think of a great idea six months from now?
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
You can’t run around and add a button to these things.
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
They’re already shipped.
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,840
So, what do you do?
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,840
It doesn’t work because the buttons and the controls can’t change.
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
They can’t change for each application,
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,840
and they can’t change down the road if you think of another great idea you want to add to this product.
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
How do you solve this?
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
It turns out we have solved it.
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,840
We solved it in computers 20 years ago.
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,840
We solved it with a bitmap screen that could display anything we want,
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,840
put any user interface up, and a pointing device.
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,840
We solved it with the mouse, right?
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,840
We solved this problem.
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,840
So, how are we going to take this to a mobile device?
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,840
Well, what we’re going to do is get rid of all these buttons and just make a giant screen.
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,840
A giant screen.
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,840
Now, how are we going to communicate this?
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
We don’t want to carry around a mouse, right?
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
So, what are we going to do?
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Oh, a stylus, right?
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,840
We’re going to use a stylus.
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
No.
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,840
Who wants a stylus?
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,840
You have to get them and put them away, and you lose them.
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
Yuck.
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Nobody wants a stylus.
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,840
Let’s not use a stylus.
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,840
We’re going to use the best pointing device in the world.
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,840
We’re going to use a pointing device that we’re all born with.
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
We’re born with ten of them.
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,840
We’re going to use our fingers.
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,840
We’re going to touch this with our fingers.
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,840
And we have invented a new technology called multi-touch, which is phenomenal.
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,840
It works like magic.
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,840
You don’t need a stylus.
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,840
It’s far more accurate than any touch display that’s ever been shipped.
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
It ignores unintended touches.
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
It’s super smart.
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,840
You can do multi-finger gestures on it.
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,840
And boy, have we patented it.
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:55,840
So, we’ve been very lucky to have brought a few revolutionary user interfaces to the market in our time.
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,840
First was the mouse.
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,840
The second was the click wheel.
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,840
And now we’re going to bring multi-touch to the market.
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,840
And each of these revolutionary user interfaces has made possible a revolutionary product.
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,840
The Mac, the iPod, and now the iPhone.
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,840
So, a revolutionary user interface.
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,840
We’re going to build on top of that with software.
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,840
Now, software on mobile phones is like baby software.
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,840
It’s not so powerful.
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,840
And today, we’re going to show you a software breakthrough.
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Software that’s at least five years ahead of what’s on any other phone.
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Now, how do we do this?
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Well, we start with a strong foundation.
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,840
iPhone runs OS X.
00:08:46,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Now, why would we want to run such a sophisticated operating system on a mobile device?
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Well, because it’s got everything we need.
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,840
It’s got multitasking.
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840
It’s got the best networking.
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,840
It already knows how to power manage.
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,840
We’ve been doing this on mobile computers for years.
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
It’s got awesome security.
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
And the right apps.
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,840
It’s got everything from Coco and the graphics.
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,840
And it’s got core animation built in.
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,840
And it’s got the audio and video that OS X is famous for.
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,840
It’s got all the stuff we want.
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,840
And it’s built right in to iPhone.
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:35,840
And that has let us create desktop class applications and networking.
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Right?
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,840
Not the crippled stuff that you find on most phones.
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,840
This is real desktop class applications.
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Now, you know, one of the pioneers of our industry, Alan Kay, has had a lot of great quotes throughout the years.
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:57,840
And I ran across one of them recently that explains how we look at this.
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Explains why we go about doing things the way we do.
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Because we love software.
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,840
And here’s the quote.
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,840
People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,840
Now, Alan said this 30 years ago.
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
And this is how we feel about it.
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,840
And so we’re bringing breakthrough software to a mobile device for the first time.
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,840
It’s five years ahead of anything on any other phone.
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,840
The second thing we’re doing is we’re learning from the iPod.
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Syncing with iTunes.
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,840
You know, we’re going to ship our 100 millionth iPod this year.
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:40,840
And that’s tens of millions of people that know how to sync these devices with their PCs or Mac
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,840
and sync all of their media right onto their iPod.
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Right?
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,840
So you just drop your iPod in and it automatically syncs.
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
You’re going to do the same thing with iPhone.
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,840
It automatically syncs to your PC or Mac right through iTunes.
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,840
And iTunes is going to sync all your media onto your iPhone.
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Your music, your audio books, podcasts, movies, TV shows, music videos.
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,840
But it also syncs a ton of data.
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Your contacts, your calendars, and your photos, which you can get on your iPod today,
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,840
your notes, your bookmarks from your web browser, your e-mail accounts, your whole e-mail setup,
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,840
all that stuff can be moved over to iPhone completely automatically.
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
It’s really nice.
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,840
And we do it through iTunes.
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Again, you go to iTunes and you set it up just like you’d set up an iPod or an Apple TV.
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,840
And you set up what you want synced to your iPhone.
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
And it’s just like an iPod.
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,840
Charge and sync.
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,840
So sync with iTunes.
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Third thing I want to talk about a little is design.
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,840
We’ve designed something wonderful for your hand.
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Just wonderful.
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,840
And this is what it looks like.
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
It’s got a three-and-a-half-inch screen on it.
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
It’s really big.
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,840
And it’s the highest resolution screen we’ve ever shipped.
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,840
It’s 160 pixels per inch.
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Highest we’ve ever shipped.
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
It’s gorgeous.
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,840
And on the front, there’s only one button down there.
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
We call it the home button.
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
It takes you home from wherever you are.
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,840
And that’s it.
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
Let’s take a look at the side.
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,840
It’s really thin.
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,840
It’s thinner than any smartphone out there at 11.6 millimeters.
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Thinner than the Q.
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Thinner than the Blackjack.
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Thinner than all of them.
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
It’s really nice.
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
And we’ve got some controls on the side.
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,840
We’ve got a little switch for ring and silent.
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,840
We’ve got a volume up and down control.
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,840
Let’s look at the back.
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,840
On the back, the biggest thing of note is we’ve got a 2-megapixel camera built right in.
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,840
The other side, we’re back on the front.
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
So let’s take a look at the top now.
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,840
We’ve got a headset jack.
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
3.5 millimeter.
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,840
All your iPod headphones fit right in.
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,840
We’ve got a place, a little tray for your SIM card.
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,840
And we’ve got one switch for sleep and wake.
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
Just push it to go to sleep.
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
Push it to wake up.
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Let’s take a look at the bottom.
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,840
We’ve got a speaker.
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,840
We’ve got a microphone.
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,840
And we’ve got our 30-pin iPod connector.
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,840
So that’s the bottom.
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,840
Now, we’ve also got some stuff you can’t see.
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,840
We’ve got three really advanced sensors built into this phone.
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
The first one is a proximity sensor.
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
It senses when physical objects get close.
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,840
So when you bring iPhone up to your ear to take a phone call,
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,840
it turns off the display and it turns off the touch sensor instantly.
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Why do you want to do that?
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Well, one, to save battery, but two, so you don’t get spurious inputs from your face into the touch screen.
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
It just automatically turns them off.
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
Take it away.
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
Boom, it’s back on.
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,840
So it’s got a proximity sensor built in.
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
It’s got an ambient light sensor as well.
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,840
We sense the ambient lighting conditions and adjust the brightness of the display
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,840
to match the ambient lighting conditions.
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,840
Again, better user experience saves power.
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,840
And the third thing we’ve got is an accelerometer
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,840
so that we can tell when you switch from portrait to landscape.
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
It’s pretty cool.
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,840
I’ll show it to you in a minute.
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,840
So three advanced sensors built in.
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,840
So let’s go ahead and turn it on.
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
This is the size of it.
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,840
It fits beautifully in the palm of your hand.
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:24,840
So an iPod, a phone, and an Internet communicator.
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,840
Let’s start with the iPod.
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,840
You can touch your music.
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
You can just touch your music.
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
It’s so cool.
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
You’ve got a widescreen video.
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,840
You can find your music even faster.
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,840
Gorgeous album art on this display.
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Built-in speaker and, why not,
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
cover flow.
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,840
First time ever on an iPod.
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
So rather than talk about this some more,
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
let me show it to you.
00:14:52,840 --> 00:15:03,840
All righty.
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,840
Now, I’ve got some special iPhones up here.
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
They’ve got a little special board in them
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,840
so I can get some digital video out.
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,840
I’ve got a little cord here which goes up to these projectors.
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,840
And so I’ve got some great images.
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,840
And you get to see what it really looks like.
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,840
So let me, I’ve got a camera here
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,840
so you can see what I’m doing with my finger for a few seconds.
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,840
And let me go ahead and get that picture within picture up.
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,840
I’m going to go ahead and just push the sleep-wake button.
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
There we go, right there.
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,840
And to unlock the phone, I just take my finger
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,840
and slide it across.
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,840
All right, you want to see that again?
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Go to sleep.
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,840
We wanted something that you couldn’t do by accident
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,840
and just slide it across.
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
Boom.
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,840
And this is the home screen of iPhone right here.
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,840
And so if I want to get in the iPod,
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,840
I just go down that lower right-hand corner
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840
and push this icon right here.
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,840
And boom, I’m in the iPod.
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
I want to get home, I push the home button right here,
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,840
and I’m home.
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,840
Back in the iPod, I’m back in the iPod.
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Now, here I am.
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
You see five buttons across the bottom.
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Playlists, artists, songs, videos, and more.
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
I’m in artists right now.
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Well, how do I scroll through my list of artists?
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
How do I do this?
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,840
I just take my finger and I scroll.
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,840
That’s it.
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Isn’t that cool?
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,840
A little rubber banding up when I run off the edge.
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
And if I want to pick somebody,
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
let’s say I want to pick the Beatles,
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,840
I just tap them.
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,840
And here’s the Beatles songs with their albums right here.
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,840
I want to play Sgt. Pepper,
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,840
so I just hit Sgt. Pepper’s right there.
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,840
And a little help from my friends.
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,840
Look at this gorgeous album artwork here.
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Of course, I’ve got a volume control.
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Now, I’ve got a little button up in the corner right here.
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,840
You can see in the upper right-hand corner,
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,840
I can hit that and flip the album art around.
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,840
Here’s all the other songs back here.
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,840
And I can play Lovely Rita if I want to.
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,840
Flip it back around.
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,840
Very simple.
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,840
I can set some stars back here just by setting the arrows.
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,840
That’s a five star album.
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,840
Isn’t that cool?
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,840
Yeah, it’s pretty nice.
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:33,840
Now, let me show you something else.
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,840
I just take my unit here and I turn it landscape mode.
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,840
And what happens?
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,840
I’m in cover flow.
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,840
Let’s go into Dylan here.
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:52,840
Let’s play Like a Rolling Stone.
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,840
I just thump through.
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Thump through my albums.
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,840
It’s real easy.
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,840
Anytime I find something I like,
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,840
turn it around, play something.
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:30,840
It’s that easy.
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
It’s that simple.
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Isn’t that great?
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:46,840
Yeah.
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
All right.
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,840
I could play with this for a long time.
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
Now, again, I’ve got playlists here.
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
I can go into my playlists.
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,840
I’ve got artists.
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,840
I’ve got songs.
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,840
I’ve got more over here.
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,840
I’ve got albums.
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,840
I’ve got a great album view, again,
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,840
which shows all my album artwork right here if I want.
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,840
And I’ve also got audio books and compilations and things like that.
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
I’ve also got videos here.
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
So I push videos and I’ve got here,
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,840
I’ve got a video podcast loaded on and a music video.
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
I’ve got a TV show and a movie.
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,840
And I’d like to just show you the TV show here.
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
This is an episode from The Office.
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,840
All videos we look at in Landscape.
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:30,840
And now, an NBC presentation.
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
Hey.
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Who were you faxing so early in the morning?
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,840
Oh, kind of hard to explain.
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,840
I don’t have a ton of contact with this Granton branch,
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,840
but before I left, I took a box of Dwight stationery.
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,840
So from time to time, I send Dwight faxes.
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
From himself.
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,840
From the future.
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,840
Dwight, at 8 a.m. today, someone poisons the coffee.
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
Do not drink the coffee.
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,840
More instructions will follow.
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,840
Cordially, future Dwight.
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:18,840
No!
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,840
We have touch controls on here, of course.
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Isn’t that awesome?
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,840
Let’s go.
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,840
Now I want to show you a movie playing.
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,840
Let’s play Pirates of the Caribbean, the second one here.
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
Great movie, by the way.
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,840
And…
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,840
The bright side is, you’re back and made it all free.
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,840
This is a widescreen movie, so I just double tap
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
and I can see the whole thing here.
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,840
Or I can fill up the screen.
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:57,840
Whichever I like.
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
And again, I’ve got on-screen controls here.
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,840
Isn’t this cool?
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,840
We can be watching feature-length movies just like this.
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
Alrighty.
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,840
So that is the iPod.
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,840
Pretty cool, huh?
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,840
We’ve just started.
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,840
So again, touch your music.
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Scroll through your songs.
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,840
Scroll through your playlists.
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,840
It’s incredible.
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,840
Widescreen video like you’ve never seen on a portable device.
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,840
160 pixels per inch.
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,840
Gorgeous screen quality.
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,840
Gorgeous album art.
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,840
And cover flow.
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,840
It’s the best iPod we’ve ever made.
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Again, some of the screenshots.
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,840
It’s unbelievable.
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,840
Here’s some album art I just put up so you can see what it looks like.
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:03,840
Just no matter what you like, it looks pretty doggone gorgeous.
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:14,840
And, of course, cover flow and video with on-screen controls.
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,840
You know, I was showing this to somebody.
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,840
I was giving a demo to somebody a little while ago who had never seen this before inside Apple.
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,840
And I finished the demo.
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,840
I said, what do you think?
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
And he told me this.
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,840
He said, you had me at scrolling.
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,840
So, the iPhone with the most amazing iPod ever.
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,840
You can now touch your music.
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
So that’s the iPod.
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,840
Now, let’s take a look at a revolutionary phone.
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
We want to reinvent the phone.
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,840
Now, what’s the killer app?
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,840
The killer app is making calls.
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,840
It’s amazing.
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,840
It’s amazing how hard it is to make calls on most phones.
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,840
Most people actually dial them every time.
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Most people don’t have very many numbers in their address book.
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,840
They use their recents as their address book, right?
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
How many of you do that?
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
I bet more than a few.
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,840
So, we want to let you use contacts like never before.
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,840
You can sync your iPhone with your PC or Mac and bring down all your contacts right into your phone.
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,840
So you’ve got everybody’s numbers with you at all times.
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,840
We have something that’s going to revolutionize voicemail today.
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,840
We call it visual voicemail.
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Wouldn’t it be great if you didn’t, if you had six voicemails,
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,840
if you didn’t have to listen to five of them first before you wanted to listen to the sixth?
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,840
Wouldn’t that be great if you had random access voicemail?
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,840
Well, we’ve got it.
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,840
Just like email, you can go directly to the voicemails that interest you.
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Excellent audio quality.
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,840
iPhone is a quad band GSM plus edge phone.
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:04,840
We have decided to go with the most popular international standard, which is GSM.
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,840
We’re on that bandwagon, headed on that road map,
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,840
and plan to make 3G phones and all sorts of other amazing things in the future.
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,840
So, quad band GSM plus edge.
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,840
And, of course, we have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 2.0 EDR built in as well.
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,840
And so this is what it looks like when you get a call.
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
This is what it sounds like.
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,840
It’s one of our ringtones you can pick, of course.
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,840
So, I want to show you four things.
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:45,840
I want to show you the phone app, photos, got a calendar, and SMS messaging.
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,840
The kind of things you would find on a typical phone, but in a very untypical way now.
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,840
So let’s go ahead and take a look.
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,840
So let’s go to our phone first.
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,840
You see that icon in the lower left-hand corner of the phone?
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,840
I just push it right here, and boom, I’m in the phone.
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,840
And I’ve got five buttons across the bottom.
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,840
Favorites, Recents, Contacts, Keypad, and Voicemail.
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,840
I’m in Contacts right now, again.
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,840
How do I move around my contacts?
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,840
I just scroll through them.
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,840
And so, let’s say I want to make a call to Johnny Ive.
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,840
I can just push here, and I see Johnny Ive’s contacts with all his information.
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,840
His three phone numbers, his email, whatever else, his address, whatever else I’ve got.
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
It’s all in one place.
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,840
And if I want to call Johnny, all I do is push his phone number, and I’ll call his mobile number right now.
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,840
And now we are calling Johnny here.
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,840
I can turn on a speakerphone like this if I wanted to.
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
Hey, Johnny, how are you doing?
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,840
I’m good. How are you doing?
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:57,840
Well, it’s been two and a half years, and I can’t tell you how thrilled I am to make the first public phone call with iPhone.
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:04,840
I remember when we first started working on this, and it’s just unbelievable.
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,840
Whoa, whoa, what is this?
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
I’ve got another call coming in.
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,840
Johnny, can I put you on hold for a minute?
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,840
Yeah, sure.
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
Okay.
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,840
So I put Johnny on hold, and I have been on hold for two and a half years.
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,840
And I’m ready to go.
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
I’m going to go to his phone.
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,840
Okay.
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840
So I put Johnny on hold.
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
Hi, Phil.
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,840
Hi, Steve.
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,840
I wanted to be the first call.
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840
Sorry, Phil.
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,840
As you can see, it’s put Johnny on hold.
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,840
And, Phil, I can just touch Johnny and bring Johnny back.
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Hey, Johnny, are you there?
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
Yeah, I’m here.
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
Hey, listen, Phil called.
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,840
Do you mind if I conference him in?
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,840
I can’t get through.
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,840
You can see the button has changed to merge calls right there in the middle.
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,840
So I just pushed that right here.
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840
And now I’ve created a conference call.
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,840
Johnny, are you there?
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,840
I’m here.
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
Phil, are you there?
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,840
I’m still hanging on.
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,840
So here we are.
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,840
And, listen, I’ve got to get back to my keynote.
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,840
So if I want to do that, I just touch this arrow right here.
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,840
And I’m going to go ahead and take Johnny private here and put Phil on hold.
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,840
Johnny, do you have anything to say on the first phone call?
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,840
It’s not too shabby, is it?
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,840
It’s not too shabby.
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,840
You take care, Johnny.
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
I’ll see you later.
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
And I end this call, and Phil’s on hold.
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
I take him off a hold.
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
Phil, thanks very much.
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
I’ve got to get back to the keynote now.
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
All right.
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
Talk to you later.
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,840
Bye-bye.
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Bye.
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
All righty.
00:27:51,840 --> 00:28:00,840
So now I’ve also got a way to make a list of favorites here for my most often called numbers.
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
So I can just touch it once and dial the number.
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
And I might want to add somebody to favorites.
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,840
So let’s say I want to add Phil Schiller.
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,840
I just push that plus button in the upper right-hand corner right there.
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,840
And up pop my favorites.
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,840
And I can just go to the S’s here.
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
And there’s Phil.
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,840
So Phil Schiller is right there.
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,840
And I’ll put, let’s say I want to put Phil’s work number.
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
And it’s added Phil right there.
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
You can see the favorites.
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,840
I can edit favorites by pushing the edit button in the upper left-hand corner.
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,840
And I can move Phil up if I want to, you know, maybe to the top.
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,840
And let’s say I’m not going to, you know, Todd, Tony’s changed his number.
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
I’ve got to update this anyway.
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
So I’m going to get rid of that.
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
And I can just remove Tony.
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
Boom.
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
There we go.
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,840
It’s that simple to edit these things.
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
Very, very easy.
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,840
I’ve got recents right here, which is all my recent phone calls.
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
If I want to see the ones I’ve missed, which are in red,
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,840
I can just go up and touch that button at the top.
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,840
And, boom, those are all the ones I’ve missed.
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,840
And those are all the calls that I’ve placed or have gotten.
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,840
If I want to dial the phone, if I’m real last century, I can push keypad here.
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,840
And I can dial a call just with, oops, called four.
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
Sorry.
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,840
Wrong number.
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,840
408-996-1010.
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840
And it formats the numbers.
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,840
And if I want to, I can just keep dialing.
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
Let’s say it’s a European number.
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,840
And the numbers just keep getting smaller.
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,840
Real simple.
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,840
Very simple to dial with a keypad.
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Now let me show you visual voicemail.
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
This is so cool.
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,840
This is a collaboration that we’ve done, which I’ll talk more about later.
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:42,840
And it allows us to have random access voicemail,
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
go directly to the voicemails we want.
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,840
So as an example, I come to my voicemail, and I say, oh, there’s one by Al Gore.
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
I want to hear that one.
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
I just push it.
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,840
Hi, David Tal.
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
Wish I could be there today.
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,840
I’m here in Nashville training people to give my slideshow.
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,840
But I wanted to say congratulations on the iPhone.
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,840
It is unbelievably cool.
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
Good luck with the presentation.
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
Call me later.
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,840
Now if I want to call Al back right now, I can just push that call back button.
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,840
But I want to listen to one from Tim Cook I’ve got here.
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,840
So let me listen to Tim.
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
Hi, David Tal.
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,840
I’ve got the results from last quarter.
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,840
Revenue was, you know, I’ll just wait and tell you when I see you in person.
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840
Good luck on the Q&A.
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,840
See you there.
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
Isn’t this awesome?
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,840
And so I’ve got voicemail, how I want to listen to it, when I want to listen to it,
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,840
in any order I want to listen to it with visual voicemail.
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,840
So that is a quick tour of the phone app.
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,840
Now what I want to do is show you SMS texting.
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,840
So I just go to that SMS icon in the upper left-hand corner and push it.
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,840
And I not only have SMS texting, but I have multiple sessions.
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,840
So I can be carrying on conversations with people,
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,840
and every time I get a new message from them, I’ll be alerted to that,
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,840
and I can go check it out.
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,840
So as an example here, I’ve got Eddie Q,
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
and I’ve been carrying on a conversation with Eddie.
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,840
And I just tap this, and here’s the conversation I’ve been carrying on right here.
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
Right?
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
And if there’s a new message, it’ll tell me.
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,840
So there’s a new message from Phil.
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
And let’s see.
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
The conversation was what?
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
Hey, Steve.
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
Hi.
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Still on for dinner tonight?
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
Absolutely.
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,840
Your turn to pick.
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
I’ve picked Sushi Ron.
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,840
How about 7 o’clock tonight?
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,840
And I can just say, you know, sounds great.
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,840
And I’ve got this little keyboard, which is phenomenal.
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,840
It does error prevention and correction.
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
Not that I won’t make some.
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,840
I probably will.
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
But it’s actually really fast to type on.
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,840
It’s faster than all these little plastic keyboards on all these smartphones.
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:43,840
So I can just say, sounds great.
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:53,840
See you there.
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,840
And I can send that.
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
And there it is.
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,840
Right?
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,840
It’s so simple.
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840
And when Phil messages me back, I’ll be alerted.
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
I’ll see the dot.
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,840
And I can just go pick up that conversation where it left off.
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,840
If I want to send a message to Eddie or Scott, I just push this and send a message and go.
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,840
It’s so simple.
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,840
So that’s SMS messaging.
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,840
And, you know, again, you’ve seen the keyboard.
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,840
It’s pretty awesome.
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,840
We’ll come back to that a little bit later.
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,840
And the third app I want to show you as part of the phone package is Photos.
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,840
We have a 2 megapixel camera built in, as I said.
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,840
We also have the coolest photo management app ever.
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,840
Certainly on a mobile device, but I think maybe ever.
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,840
And so here’s our photos.
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840
I’m going to go into our photo library.
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
And this is our library.
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,840
And, again, I can just scroll through photos here with my finger.
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,840
Pretty cool.
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Let me go to photo album.
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
I’ll pick Italy.
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
And I just – let’s start at the top.
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,840
And to go through pictures, I just swipe them.
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,840
I just swipe through my photo library.
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,840
There’s one that’s landscape.
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,840
I can just turn my device and take a look at it.
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,840
Pretty cool, huh?
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,840
So I can even swipe when I’m in landscape here.
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
Isn’t this awesome?
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,840
The other thing I can do is I can take any of these pictures and I can make them bigger.
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,840
And so let me go ahead and get the camera back up.
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,840
Yeah, there it is right there.
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,840
I can just take my fingers and I can – we call it the pinch.
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,840
I can bring them closer together and move them further apart to make it bigger or smaller.
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,840
And so I can just move them further apart and stretch the image.
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,840
Isn’t that cool?
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,840
And move it around.
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,840
Isn’t that cool?
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:53,840
And now what I can do is I can pick to make this my wallpaper.
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,840
And, of course, I could jigger it around then and just set the wallpaper.
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:07,840
And now if I’m back at home and I go to sleep, when I wake up from here on out until I reset it, that’s my wallpaper.
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Whenever I’m making a call, that’s what I’m going to see.
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Boom.
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,840
There we go.
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:17,840
So photos, SMS, and the phone app.
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:30,840
That is part of our phone package for iPhone.
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
Get a call.
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,840
Again, really great call management features.
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,840
Just scroll through contacts with your finger.
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,840
All the information at your fingertips here.
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Favorites.
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Last century.
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,840
Visual voicemail.
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Calendar.
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,840
SMS texting.
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,840
Incredible photo app.
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,840
The ability to just take any picture and make it your wallpaper.
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
It’s pretty unbelievable.
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:06,840
And I think when you have a chance to get your hand on it, you’ll agree, we have reinvented the phone.
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Okay.
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:19,840
So now let’s take a look at an internet communications device.
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,840
It’s part of iPhone.
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,840
So what’s this all about?
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Well, we’ve got some real breakthroughs here.
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,840
To start off with, we’ve got rich HTML email on iPhone.
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,840
The first time really rich email on a mobile device.
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,840
And it works with any IMAP or POP email service.
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,840
You’ve got your favorite mail service.
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,840
It’ll likely work with it.
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,840
And it’s rich text email.
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,840
We wanted the best web browser in the world on our phone.
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,840
Not a baby web browser or a WAP browser.
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,840
A real web browser.
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
And we picked the best one in the world, Safari.
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,840
And we have Safari running on iPhone.
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:09,840
It is the first fully usable HTML browser on a phone.
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:15,840
Third, we have Google Maps.
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,840
Maps, satellite images, directions and traffic.
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,840
This is unbelievable.
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Wait till you see it.
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,840
We have widgets starting off with weather and stocks.
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,840
And then this communicates with the Internet over edge and Wi-Fi.
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,840
And iPhone automatically detects Wi-Fi and switches seamlessly to it.
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,840
You don’t have to manage the network.
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,840
It just does the right thing.
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,840
Now, I want to take a second and talk about email.
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,840
We hook up to almost any IMAP or POP3 mail service.
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,840
I just want to give you some examples.
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,840
IMAP, of course, is the best because you can keep your folders
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,840
and all your email on the server and access it from anywhere.
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,840
Yahoo Mail is IMAP.
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,840
Microsoft Exchange has an IMAP option.
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,840
And obviously, .Mac Mail is IMAP as well.
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:12,840
POP3, Google Gmail, AOL Mail, and most ISPs are POP3 email.
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:17,840
Now, I want to take a minute and highlight one, Yahoo Mail.
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,840
Yahoo Mail is the biggest mail service in the world.
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,840
They have over a quarter billion users.
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,840
Biggest email service in the world.
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,840
And today, we are announcing with Yahoo that they are going to provide
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,840
free push IMAP email to all iPhone customers.
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,840
So this isn’t just IMAP email.
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,840
It is push IMAP email.
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,840
So when you get a message, it will push it right out to the phone for you.
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,840
Same as a Blackberry.
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,840
Free IMAP push email from Yahoo.
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840
So we think this is a pretty big deal.
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:58,840
So what I’d like to do now is I’d like to show you Mail, Safari, Google Maps,
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,840
and widgets running on iPhone.
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
So let’s go see.
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,840
So let’s go into Mail.
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
Second icon from the left on the bottom there.
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,840
I just touch it with my finger, and boom, I’m there.
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,840
And so I’ve got an inbox here.
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,840
And this is, by the way, running live on Yahoo IMAP email.
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,840
This stuff is coming off a Yahoo server somewhere up in the cloud.
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,840
And so I can say, James Vincent here sent me an email.
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,840
He’s a proud father.
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,840
And there we go.
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,840
And I can just scroll it here.
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,840
I’ve got inline photos, rich text email.
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,840
There we go.
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,840
Let’s look at another one.
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,840
Phil Schiller.
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,840
She loved the gift.
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,840
Again, inline photos, rich text.
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,840
Pretty nice.
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,840
Shopping list.
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,840
Again, rich text right here.
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,840
Pretty cool.
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
Directions to Sushi Ron for tonight’s dinner.
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,840
Now, iPhone, of course, parses out phone numbers.
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,840
And as you can see, there’s a phone number in blue.
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,840
I can just touch it, and boom, I’m going to call this place.
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
All right?
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,840
I don’t really want to call him, so I’m going to end the call here.
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
You get the idea.
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,840
And this last one, Ken Bureskin is one of our marketing folks.
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,840
He just returned from Antarctica.
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:30,840
Ken’s a great photographer, and he took all these great photos of penguins in Antarctica.
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,840
It’s really cool.
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,840
Look at this.
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,840
Isn’t this great?
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,840
Right in your email, right on your phone.
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:42,840
And if I want to, by the way, I can look at my email with a split view, just like I do on my computer.
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,840
And so I can select something here and just look at it down here if I want to peruse my messages real fast
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,840
and just find that one message I was looking for.
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,840
But I actually like the full screen view.
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:58,840
And, of course, we have a standard inbox and drafts and all sorts of folders you can put things in as well.
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:03,840
So it’s real email, just like you’re used to on your computer, right here on your phone.
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,840
It’s extraordinary.
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,840
And, again, free IMAP email from Yahoo.
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,840
Now, let me go ahead and just create an email message, show you what that’s like.
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,840
So, again, when I don’t need the keyboard, it’s not there.
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,840
When I do, it’s there.
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,840
I want to send a message to, let’s say, Phil.
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,840
I just type PH, and boom, Phil Schiller.
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,840
It’s address completion.
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,840
And maybe I’ll send one to Scott Forestall as well.
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,840
And there’s Scott right there.
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,840
And let’s say the subject is dinner.
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:46,840
Dinner and, you know, see you tonight.
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,840
Boom.
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,840
And I just send send, sends that email, and we’re done.
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,840
So that is mail.
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,840
Full desktop class email running on a mobile device.
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,840
All right, now I want to show you something incredible.
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,840
I want to show you Safari running on a mobile device.
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,840
So let’s go to the web.
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,840
And here we are.
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:27,840
I’m going to load in, rather than Apple.com here, a little more universal site.
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,840
I’m going to load in the New York Times.
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
It’s kind of a slow site because it’s got a lot of images.
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,840
But here we are loading it.
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,840
We’re loading it over Wi-Fi right now.
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,840
And rather than just give you a WAP version of the New York Times,
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,840
rather than give you this wrapped version all around,
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,840
we’re showing you the whole New York Times website.
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,840
And there it is.
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
And guess what I can do?
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,840
I can just put this into landscape mode, and there it is right there.
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,840
And I can scroll here if I want.
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,840
Scroll up and down here.
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,840
Boom.
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,840
Still loading it in.
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,840
There we go.
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
Or I can just get back like this.
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,840
Now, this is really great, and I can see the whole page,
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
but, of course, I can’t read it.
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
It’s a little too small.
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,840
So I can get in with my fingers and pinch it,
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,840
but we have an optimization here.
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,840
I can just double tap on anything,
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,840
and it automatically fills up the screen with it.
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,840
And I can just scroll around like this and scroll over here,
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,840
and I can even make this text bigger if I want to.
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,840
And there it is.
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,840
There it is.
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:36,840
And just double tap again to get back to the full page.
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
Isn’t this cool?
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,840
And so I’m just, look at this.
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,840
There is the New York Times.
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,840
And, again, any article I want, boom.
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:49,840
There we go.
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,840
Boom.
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,840
Unbelievable.
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,840
Now, you can look at multiple webpages as well.
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,840
You can have multiple webpages open.
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,840
So I just push this button in the lower right-hand corner,
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,840
shrinks it down, and I can add a new page if I want.
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,840
And I’ll go to Amazon here out of my bookmarks.
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,840
So let’s go to Amazon.
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,840
And I love to go to the DVD section of Amazon
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,840
and see what DVDs are selling.
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,840
I like it especially when Disney’s are at the top.
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,840
And so here’s Amazon coming in.
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,840
Even before the whole page is loaded,
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,840
I’m just going to double tap on this.
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,840
And I’m going to say let’s go to the DVD section here.
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:34,840
And now it’s doing that.
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:41,840
And here we are.
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,840
And there’s a section over here on the right-hand side right there.
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,840
And these are the top sellers, updated hourly.
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,840
Oh, look.
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,840
Al’s An Inconvenient Truth is number one.
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,840
All right.
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,840
And here’s all the other movies.
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,840
Ray’s Anatomy, I like that.
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,840
Pirates of the Caribbean, fantastic.
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,840
And so I’ve got this right here,
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,840
and I can go back to the New York Times if I want.
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,840
Let’s zoom up to that picture so we can all see it.
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,840
And again, here.
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,840
Isn’t this cool?
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,840
Just over there.
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,840
Go back to this one.
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,840
I can get rid of them just by hitting the X.
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,840
And there we go.
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,840
Isn’t that incredible?
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:23,840
Safari.
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:29,840
Now, if you’ve ever used what’s called a web browser on a mobile phone,
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,840
you’ll know how incredible this is.
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:37,840
I hope you never really know because it’s bad out there today.
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,840
And this is a revolution of the first order
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,840
to really bring the real Internet to your phone.
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,840
Let me show you some about widgets here.
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,840
Let’s go to stocks right now,
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,840
and we’re going to load stock information off the web.
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,840
And just right onto the phone here.
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,840
Oh, look, Apple’s up.
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,840
That’s great.
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,840
Now I can look at different graphs here if I want to.
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,840
And that’s fantastic.
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,840
Let’s look at the percentages here.
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,840
Oh, good.
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,840
Good, good.
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,840
So I’ve got stocks right here, and I can go look at the weather.
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:18,840
Let’s see what it’s like outside.
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,840
49 degrees.
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,840
But it’s supposed to get to 61 today, so that’s good.
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,840
We’ll just stay in here until it warms up.
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,840
Now, I’ve got Paris right here.
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,840
I can have as many of these as I want, so it’s nighttime in Paris.
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,840
It’s actually warmer in Paris at night than it is here today.
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,840
Wow.
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,840
Aspen.
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,840
No snow until later in the week.
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,840
Hawaii.
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,840
Oh, it’s raining.
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,840
That’s not good.
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,840
Well, anyway, here’s four places.
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,840
Hawaii, Aspen, Paris, and San Francisco.
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,840
And again, the weather widget.
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:56,840
Now, to conclude with the Internet device section here,
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,840
I want to show you something truly remarkable,
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,840
which is Google Maps on iPhone.
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:07,840
I hit our Maps application here, and it’s coming up.
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,840
And it shows us North America.
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,840
And I’m going to go to Moscone West.
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,840
That’s where we are right now.
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,840
And here we are.
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,840
Boom.
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,840
That’s where we are.
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,840
Now, what I’m going to do is I’m going to go look for something.
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,840
I’m going to certainly want a cup of coffee afterwards,
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:28,840
so I’m just going to look for Starbucks, right?
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,840
Starbucks.
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,840
So I’m going to search for Starbucks.
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:34,840
And sure enough, there’s all the Starbucks.
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:39,840
Now, I can get a list of Starbucks here.
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,840
So I can pick that one if I want.
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,840
And I can even go look at that Starbucks.
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,840
And there it is.
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,840
And let’s give them a call.
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:58,840
Good morning.
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:59,840
Starbucks.
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,840
Can I help you?
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,840
Yes, I’d like to order 4,000 lattes to go, please.
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,840
No, just kidding.
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,840
Wrong number.
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,840
Thank you.
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,840
Bye-bye.
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:15,840
Okay.
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:22,840
Now, I can zoom in by just, again, pinching if I want to.
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,840
Or I can just double-click to zoom in.
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,840
And I get just higher and higher resolution versions of the map.
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,840
So let’s go somewhere else here that I’ve got bookmarked.
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,840
And let’s go to the Washington Monument.
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,840
And so here is Washington, D.C., and I could just double-tap.
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,840
And I’m going in a little further here, just double-tapping in.
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,840
And there’s the Washington Monument there.
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,840
And I’ll double-tap in again.
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,840
But now I want to show you something else.
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,840
Satellite images.
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,840
So I just hit this button called Satellite down at the bottom,
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,840
and it’s going to replace the map with satellite images.
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,840
There we go.
00:47:54,840 --> 00:48:00,840
And I can just double-tap in and double-tap in again.
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,840
And let’s catch it up to me here.
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,840
There we go.
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,840
And let’s double-tap in again.
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,840
This is the Washington Monument.
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,840
There we go.
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,840
Look at this.
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,840
You can see people down there.
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,840
Oops.
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,840
There we go.
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,840
Yep.
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,840
Isn’t that incredible?
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,840
Right on my phone.
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,840
It’s unbelievable.
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,840
So let’s go.
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,840
I’ve got another one, the Eiffel Tower, which is very cool.
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,840
I set this one to be, look at this, there’s the Eiffel Tower.
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,840
There’s people at the Eiffel Tower, you can see.
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,840
Look at that.
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,840
Isn’t that incredible?
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,840
And here’s just one last one.
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:46,840
I have to show you, the Colosseum in Rome.
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,840
So again, here we are in Rome.
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,840
That’s as far as we can go with the map,
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,840
but we can go a little further with the satellite.
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,840
There’s the Colosseum.
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,840
There’s the Roman Colosseum.
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,840
Satellite imagery right on the phone.
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,840
Look at that.
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,840
That’s the Colosseum.
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,840
Unbelievable.
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,840
Right on our phone.
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,840
What do you think?
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,840
Isn’t that incredible?
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:18,840
Go.
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,840
So, all these amazing things.
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:27,840
This is a breakthrough internet communicator built right into iPhone.
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,840
The first rich HTML email on a phone.
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,840
The first real web browser on a phone.
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,840
Best version of Google Maps on the planet.
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,840
Widgets, and all with edge and Wi-Fi networking.
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,840
We’re very, very happy with this.
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,840
Again, email.
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,840
Push, email, IMAP, free, Yahoo,
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:56,840
and almost any other IMAP and Popmail service you want to hook up to.
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,840
Incredible new technology for entering text.
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,840
Far better than we’ve seen on phones before.
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,840
A real browser on the phone.
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,840
We can see real web pages in portrait or landscape.
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:11,840
We can zoom in on what we want to take a look at more closely.
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:16,840
Google Maps and widgets.
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,840
It’s the internet in your pocket for the first time ever.
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,840
Now, you can’t really think about the internet, of course,
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,840
without thinking about Google, right?
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,840
And for Google, what we have on our phone, working with them,
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,840
is, of course, Google Search.
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,840
We have that built right into the browser.
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,840
Just type what you want.
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,840
Hit Google, and you’re off.
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,840
And Google Maps.
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,840
We’ve been working very closely with them to make this all happen.
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,840
We’re thrilled with the results.
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:49,840
And it’s my pleasure now to introduce Dr. Eric Schmidt, Google’s CEO.
00:50:49,840 --> 00:51:00,840
Congratulations, Steve.
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:08,840
What an incredible job.
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:13,840
So, Steve, you know, I’ve had the privilege of joining the board,
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,840
and there’s a lot of relationships between the boards.
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,840
And I thought, you know, if we just sort of merge the companies,
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,840
we could call them Apple Goo.
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,840
But I’m not a marketing guy.
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,840
What I like about this new device and the new architecture of the internet
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,840
is that you can actually merge without merging.
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:39,840
Steve says that each company should do the absolutely best thing that they can do every time,
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,840
and I think he’s shown it once again today.
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:48,840
And internet architectures, right,
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:54,840
internet architectures allow you now to take the enormous brain trust
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,840
that is represented by the Apple development team
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:02,840
and combine that with the open protocols and data services that companies like Google
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,840
and the others represented that are coming up in a bit
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,840
to actually put them together in a seamless environment for end users.
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:14,840
What I particularly like about this is it’s the first time it’s all to come together in one place.
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,840
Now, from a Google perspective,
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:21,840
what we’ve done is we’ve pushed very, very hard to partner with others
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,840
and in particular to partner with Apple.
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,840
The companies, the cultures are similar, innovation, having fun while you’re doing it,
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:31,840
and also working with many, many different data services.
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,840
So Steve showed a little bit of some of the components,
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,840
some of the pieces and so forth that you can do.
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:42,840
But understand that this is a set of data that’s from maps and partners and so forth
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,840
so that you really can get the full integration.
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,840
The person doesn’t understand how hard it was to get it all together.
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,840
It comes together seamlessly.
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:56,840
From my perspective, this is the first of a whole new generation of data services
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,840
where these powerful base cloud computers,
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,840
Google being, we hope, a leading representative,
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:06,840
provides HTML, XML, and other sophisticated services
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,840
that the Safari browser that’s embedded in the iPhone
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,840
and many other of its type devices and future devices out of Apple
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,840
will be able to take advantage.
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:20,840
Steve, my congratulations to you, and this product is going to be hot.
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,840
Thanks.
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:33,840
Thank you very much.
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:41,840
As a board member, you’ll get one of the first ones.
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,840
Okay.
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:48,840
Now, you also can’t think about the Internet without thinking about Yahoo.
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,840
And again, on the phone, we’ve got Yahoo search built right in.
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,840
You can select which one you want to use.
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,840
Just type in something, hit that Yahoo button, and boom, you’re off.
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:02,840
And of course, we also have Yahoo IMAP email services.
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:09,840
And so it is my great pleasure to introduce Jerry Yang, co-founder and chief Yahoo.
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:18,840
Jerry.
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,840
Congrats.
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,840
Thank you.
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,840
Thank you, Steve.
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:27,840
I’m not a board member of Apple, but I would love to have one of these too, obviously.
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,840
Wow.
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,840
All this for a phone.
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,840
Pretty incredible.
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:31,840
And what a great device, Steve.
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:39,840
We are really proud at Yahoo to be partnering with Apple on not only the Yahoo IMAP email, the first one we’re doing,
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:44,840
but also hopefully on a whole variety of other popular services from Yahoo.
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:49,840
One of the things that we’re going to be doing with Apple is also launching some of our new services that we announced this week,
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:54,840
the Yahoo Go, Yahoo OneSearch, and hopefully we can get Yahoo OneSearch,
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:59,840
which is one of our new products, onto this phone, which is a really innovative way of looking at search.
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,840
You’re really able to not get the traditional web search results,
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:06,840
but rather get all the things you want in a very concise format, aggregated.
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:14,840
If you type in things like San Francisco, you’ll get all the local news, local weather, and local maps all in one place.
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,840
So we’re looking forward to doing that.
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,840
As Steve said, mail is a killer app on the phone.
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:24,840
And Yahoo is really trying to redesign and re-innovate
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:28,840
and reinvent the web experience and Internet experience on the mobile devices.
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:33,840
So on the email, you can look forward not only to great web services like the best spam protection,
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,840
address books, integration, and the calendar if you’re on Yahoo.
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,840
Just think, it’s basically like having a Blackberry without the Exchange server.
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:44,840
This is really going to be really great, not only having a seamless experience from your PC,
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,840
taken to your mobile Internet.
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,840
Yeah, there’s some clapping out there. I can hear that.
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:54,840
Lastly, we want to be able to really take what Apple is doing on the phone
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:58,840
by reinventing the phone and reinventing the device.
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,840
We want to be able to do that on the Internet.
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:08,840
And what we’re doing is really being able to take great form factors, great user experiences, and great UI
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:13,840
that we’re taking from not only the web but also in the back-end services
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,840
and translate them into a seamless web experience.
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,840
So we’re big believers in great hardware and great software.
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:23,840
And we’re big believers in taking the web services and Web 2.0 model and taking it to the device world.
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:27,840
So, Steve, my address, you got it all.
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,840
Please send it to me. Thanks again.
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,840
Great to be your partner. Thank you.
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:49,840
You know, it’s been great having the two greatest companies on the web right down the block, Google and Yahoo.
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,840
And we’ve been able to work with these guys really closely.
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:57,840
And it’s been an incredible pleasure to work on this great technology and bring it to everybody in iPhone.
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,840
So thank you guys so much.
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:06,840
You’ve really helped us put the Internet in your pocket.
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:15,840
So, Internet communicator, an iPod, and a phone.
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,840
Put them all together and see what you can do in a real-life scenario.
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,840
So, let’s take a look.
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:29,840
I want to listen to some music, so I’m going to go into my iPod here.
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:38,840
And let’s see, in Artists, I want to listen to, oh, maybe Red Hot Chili Peppers.
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,840
I love those guys.
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,840
And so I’m listening to a song of theirs.
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:50,840
And let’s see what happens when I get a phone call.
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:54,840
Music fades out.
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,840
Screen changes.
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,840
I’ve got a phone call coming in.
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:03,840
So I can ignore it, but I think I’m going to answer it.
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,840
So I’ll answer it.
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,840
Howdy.
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,840
Hi, Phil.
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,840
Now, notice who Phil is because he’s in my address book,
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,840
so it puts his little picture up here and everything up there.
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:14,840
Hi, Phil.
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,840
Listen, I’m kind of busy right now.
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,840
What can I do for you?
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:25,840
Okay.
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,840
Hold on just a sec.
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:30,840
So I push the Home button here down at the bottom, and I go home right here.
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,840
And I’m still on the call.
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:35,840
You can see the phone thing flashing right there on the lower left.
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,840
And I go into Photos, and now I’m in Photos.
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,840
And, again, you can see the bar across the top, the green bar.
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,840
I can just touch that to return to the call.
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:46,840
And Phil wants a photo that he wanted to use it for his screensaver.
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,840
It was one of the ones that was taken in Hawaii.
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,840
I think it was this one.
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,840
Yep, there it is.
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,840
So you want me to mail this to you, Phil?
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,840
That would be great.
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,840
All right.
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,840
So, again, I just go down here and push this button.
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,840
And rather than use it as wallpaper, I’m going to e-mail it.
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,840
And so watch what happens now.
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,840
It shrinks it a little bit,
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:07,840
and then a compose window will come up right behind it.
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,840
There we go.
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,840
And I will just tap in the To field and send this to Phil here.
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,840
Phil Schiller, there we go.
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,840
And the e-mail’s there.
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,840
Yep, it’s there.
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,840
And I’m just going to send it.
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,840
Hey, Phil, that should be on its way right now.
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,840
Okay, thanks.
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,840
Yep.
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,840
Anything else?
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,840
Yeah, I was kind of hoping if you’re done soon that we could not only get some dinner,
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,840
but maybe catch a movie tonight.
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,840
Is there anything you want to see?
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:32,840
Let me go check it out.
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:36,840
I think I’ve got Fandango in my bookmarks here.
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,840
And, yes, I do.
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,840
Let’s go to Fandango.
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,840
Figure out what movies are playing.
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,840
There’s nothing personal here.
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,840
We’ve got to go catch a movie.
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,840
Don’t want to read too much into it.
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,840
Okay, here’s Fandango.
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,840
Let’s just double tap.
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,840
And here’s the movies playing.
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,840
Yep.
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,840
How about we go see Night at the Museum?
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,840
I haven’t seen that yet.
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,840
Oh, I haven’t either.
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,840
Great.
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,840
All right.
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,840
Hey, take care, Phil.
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,840
Now, what I’m going to do is to go back to my call, I just touch the top here.
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,840
And I’m back at my call, and I’m just going to go ahead and end the call.
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,840
And what happens now?
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,840
Back in my music.
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:35,840
So, this is what it’s like when you put it all together.
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,840
iPhone.
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:41,840
Today, Apple is reinventing the phone.
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,840
Now, how does this stack up?
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,840
Let’s go back to these guys.
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,840
Let’s take a look.
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,840
Well, these are their home screens.
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:55,840
And, again, as you recall, this is iPhone’s home screen.
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,840
This is what their contacts look like.
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,840
This is what iPhone’s contacts look like.
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,840
And, again, you just pick one, and you see everything about that person,
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,840
all the information you have.
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,840
This is what mail looks like on these smartphones.
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,840
Again, this is what mail looks like on iPhone.
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,840
You have rich HTML, rich text email.
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,840
This is what calendars look like on these guys.
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,840
This is what calendars look like on iPhone.
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,840
This is what the web looks like.
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,840
And we tried to make it look as good as we could on these.
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,840
It usually looks worse.
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,840
And this is what you get.
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:36,840
And, of course, this is what you get on iPhone.
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,840
And you can zoom in and see anything you want.
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:43,840
And this is what you get for music players.
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,840
Nobody really uses them much.
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,840
And this is what you get on iPhone.
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:57,840
So, after today, I don’t think anyone’s going to look at these phones quite the same way again.
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,840
Now, let me tell you about some accessories we’ve got for iPhone.
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,840
We’ve got some great stereo headphones we’re going to be shipping.
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:09,840
And they’ve got a little addition to them, which is this little thing right over here.
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,840
It’s a microphone and a switch.
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,840
So you can talk.
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,840
You have them in there.
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,840
You can get a call and just talk.
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,840
They have beautiful reception on the microphone.
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:20,840
And just push it together to answer a call or hang up on a call.
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:26,840
And so you can be wearing them and it just dangles right there and picks up your voice beautifully.
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,840
And we also have a Bluetooth accessory headset that we’re going to be shipping.
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,840
And there it is right there.
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,840
It’s incredibly small.
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:39,840
And just to let you see what it looks like, it’s got one button on the top for answering and hanging up a phone call.
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,840
You never have to turn it off or on.
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,840
It just goes to sleep.
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,840
It automatically pairs with iPhones so you don’t have to worry about pairing.
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,840
It’s really simple.
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,840
And it’s very tiny.
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,840
This is what it looks like in here.
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,840
It’s just beautiful.
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,840
It’s the coolest one that we’ve ever seen.
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,840
So Bluetooth headset coming as well.
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,840
Battery life.
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,840
There’s a lot of stuff.
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:04,840
A lot of these phones, a lot of these smartphones have pretty low battery lives.
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:11,840
We’ve managed to get five hours of battery and that’s for talk time or video or browsing.
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,840
Five hours of battery life.
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:17,840
And 16 hours of audio playback.
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:23,840
So that’s dramatically better than any of these smartphones.
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:29,840
There’s a tremendous amount of high technology in iPhone.
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:34,840
We’ve been pushing the state of the art in every facet of this design.
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,840
So let me just talk a little bit about it here.
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:41,840
We’ve got the multi-touch screen, a first.
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:44,840
Miniaturization, more than we’ve ever done before.
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:48,840
A lot of custom silicon.
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,840
Tremendous power management.
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:55,840
OS 10 inside a mobile device.
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,840
Featherweight precision enclosures.
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,840
Three advanced sensors.
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,840
Desktop class applications.
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:09,840
And of course the widescreen video iPod.
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:13,840
We’ve been innovating like crazy for the last few years on this.
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,840
And we filed for over 200 patents for all the inventions in iPhone.
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,840
And we intend to protect them.
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:26,840
So a lot of high technology.
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:31,840
I think we’re advancing the state of the art in every aspect of this design.
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:35,840
So iPhone is like having your life in your pocket.
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:39,840
It’s the ultimate digital device.
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,840
So what should we price it at?
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,840
Well, what do these things normally cost?
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:53,840
An iPod, the most popular iPod, $199 for 4 gig nano.
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,840
What’s a smartphone cost?
01:04:54,840 --> 01:05:00,840
Well, they say you get the phone and some of the Internet with it, although that’s questionable.
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,840
But they cost somewhere between around $299.
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,840
You can get them for $199.
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,840
Palm just introduced a new one at $399 yesterday.
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:12,840
So generally average about $299 with a two-year contract.
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:16,840
Now, these phones sort of do music, but nobody uses them for music because they’re not very good.
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:19,840
And so they end up buying an iPod to go with the phone.
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,840
We know. We sell the iPod.
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:26,840
And so people spend $499 on this combination.
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,840
What should we charge for iPhone?
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,840
Because iPhone’s got a lot more than this stuff, right?
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,840
It’s got video, real video.
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,840
It’s got this beautiful, gorgeous wide screen.
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,840
It’s got multi-touch user interface.
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,840
It’s got Wi-Fi.
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,840
It’s got a real browser.
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:50,840
It’s got HTML email.
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,840
It’s got cover flow and on and on and on.
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,840
And this stuff would normally cost hundreds of dollars.
01:05:55,840 --> 01:06:00,840
So how much more than $499 should we price iPhone?
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:06,840
Well, we thought long and hard about it because iPhone just does so much stuff.
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:11,840
So much better experience on a call and managing your contacts and visual voicemail,
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,840
random access voicemail for the first time,
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:19,840
texting and email and real browser and Google Maps
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:25,840
and tremendous iPod and cover flow and video.
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,840
What should we price this thing at?
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:33,840
Well, for 4 gigabyte model, we’re going to price it at that same $499.
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,840
No premium whatsoever.
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,840
$499.
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:43,840
And we’re going to have an 8 gigabyte model for just $599.
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:48,840
So we’re going to price it starting at $499.
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,840
Now, when’s it going to be available?
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,840
We’re going to be shipping these in June.
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,840
Yeah, June.
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,840
We’re announcing it today because with products like this,
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:03,840
we got to go and get FCC approval, which takes a few months.
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,840
And we thought it’d be better if we introduced this
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,840
rather than ask the FCC to introduce it for us.
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,840
So here we are, and we’re going to be shipping it in June in the U.S.
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:16,840
We’re going to Europe, hopefully by the fourth calendar quarter of this year,
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,840
and Asia in 2008.
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,840
So June, in just a few months, we’ll be shipping in the U.S.
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:27,840
And when we do, our partner is going to be Singular.
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,840
We’ve chosen Singular.
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:36,840
They are the best and most popular network in the country,
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,840
58 million subscribers.
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,840
They are number one.
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,840
They are our exclusive partner in the U.S.
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,840
Now, it’s a unique partnership, though.
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:49,840
We’re not just going to be selling phones and services together.
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,840
We’re going to be doing innovation together.
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,840
We worked with Singular on visual voicemail
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:00,840
because it’s an innovation that requires both innovation on the phone and in the network.
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,840
You can’t do it in just one place.
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,840
You have to do it in both places and collaborate.
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,840
And so visual voicemail is the first fruit of this collaboration,
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,840
and you will see more.
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,840
And when we start shipping in June,
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:16,840
we’ll be selling iPhone through our own stores and through Singular stores.
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:23,840
And it’s my pleasure to introduce the CEO of Singular, Stan Sigmund.
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:37,840
Congratulations, my friend.
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:38,840
Thank you.
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,840
Welcome, Stan.
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:40,840
Thank you.
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:45,840
You know, Steve and I first met about two years ago in New York City
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:49,840
when he shared with me this vision that he had for this product.
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:52,840
And we’ve been working on it for some time.
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:58,840
It actually entered into a contractual agreement without us ever seeing the device or the phone.
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:04,840
And that was because of the confidence that I have in Steve and his leadership team
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,840
to deliver on the vision that they have.
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,840
And every time I see this, it’s just wow.
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:11,840
It’s just wow.
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,840
It’s really, really cool.
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:23,840
You’ve exceeded my expectations.
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:28,840
It’s a real honor for Singular to be partnering with Apple today.
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:32,840
And I’ve brought with me another company to celebrate in this.
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,840
And it’s a pretty big company.
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,840
It’s the new AT&T.
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:46,840
You know, 11 days ago, Singular became a full part of the new AT&T family.
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:54,840
And this new family will help fulfill the vision we have of wireline, wireless, broadband,
01:09:54,840 --> 01:10:03,840
and video coming together on one device in the ways that customers haven’t imagined.
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,840
Today, Singular and Apple are truly raising the bar.
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:16,840
We’re announcing a partnership that takes the mobile phone experience to a real new level
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:22,840
by bringing together the best network with the best device.
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:27,840
Networks are the foundation of what Singular and AT&T do.
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:34,840
Singular offers the largest digital and voice data network in America today.
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:38,840
The Singular network has the fewest dropped calls in this country.
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:46,840
And AT&T is the largest provider of broadband Internet services in this community.
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:50,840
When it comes to networks, AT&T wrote the book.
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,840
Their quality is legendary.
01:10:54,840 --> 01:11:00,840
Put this network experience that Singular and AT&T have and Apple products together,
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,840
and what do you get?
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:10,840
First, you get the best voice and data services with the best user experience available anywhere.
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:16,840
Second, you get real, compelling products and services.
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,840
For example, there’s a visual voicemail that Steve mentioned,
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:25,840
which lets you look at the voice message you want to hear and when you want to hear it.
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,840
As Steve mentioned, to create the visual voicemail,
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:36,840
it took innovation on Singular’s part at the network level and by Apple with the device.
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:40,840
And I promise you’ll see more of that coming down the road.
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:46,840
Third, when you combine Singular’s 2,100 retail stores
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:54,840
and number one wireless online store with Apple’s already legendary retail stores and online stores,
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:58,840
you’ve got unmatched distribution.
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:07,840
Yes, we’re truly pleased to partner with Apple to deliver one of the most eagerly awaited wireless products ever,
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,840
the iPhone that he showed you.
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:15,840
With the iPhone, you get a breakthrough wireless experience.
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,840
And we’ll be working shoulder to shoulder with Steve and his team
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:26,840
to make sure that the integration of the iPhone and our network is seamless.
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,840
This is only the beginning.
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:32,840
We are just introducing a new product.
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:37,840
We are changing the way companies work together.
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:43,840
Apple and Singular have a multiyear exclusive partnership.
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:49,840
The new iPhone is only available with Singular wireless services.
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,840
This is not an MVNO.
01:12:52,840 --> 01:13:01,840
Ours is a unique relationship that lets Apple be Apple and Singular be Singular.
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:11,840
Apple has built a device combining the best phone, iPod, and mobile Internet experience ever.
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,840
Our iPhone owners will be Singular and AT&T customers.
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:22,840
Our customers will get the best network and services in the business.
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:31,840
People will benefit from the best that companies, they already know and trust in what they have to offer.
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:39,840
Apple, Singular, and AT&T have come a long ways, and now we’re picking up the pace.
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:45,840
Just over six years ago, BellSouth and AT&T came together to form Singular.
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,840
Eleven days, Singular joined the new AT&T.
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:56,840
Today, Singular and AT&T are working together to provide our customers
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:02,840
the most innovative, enjoyable, and reliable service in the industry.
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:08,840
I hope you’re as excited as we are as what we have to see and enjoy here.
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,840
This is going to be a terrific ride.
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:13,840
Thank you very much, Steve, and congratulations.
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:27,840
Thank you.
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,840
You know, as Stan said, we started working together about two years ago,
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:35,840
and we come from pretty different worlds, the telecommunications industry,
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,840
the computer industry, and, of course, music with the iPod,
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:43,840
and yet we have worked wonderfully together, and we love these guys,
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,840
and we think we’re going to bring some great stuff to market over the years together.
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:57,840
So let’s take a look at this market and how big it is.
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:02,840
My clicker’s not working.
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,840
Oh, there it is. Maybe it is working.
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,840
So how big is this market?
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:17,840
Well, let’s take a look.
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,840
Clicker is not working.
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:34,840
They’re scrambling backstage right now.
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:42,840
You know, when I was in high school, Steve Wozniak and I, mostly Steve,
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:46,840
made this little device called a TV jammer,
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:50,840
and it was this little oscillator that would put out frequencies that would screw up the TV,
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:55,840
and Woz would have it in his pocket, and we’d go into, like, a dorm at Berkeley where he was going to school,
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,840
and a bunch of folks would be watching, like, Star Trek,
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,840
and he’d screw up the TV, and somebody would go up to fix it,
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,840
and just as they had their foot off the ground, he’d turn it back on.
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,840
And if they put their foot back on the ground, he’d screw up the TV again.
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:13,840
And within five minutes, he’d have somebody like this for the rest of the Star Trek episode.
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,840
Okay, so maybe it’s working now. Maybe they’re going to have to click them for me.
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:22,840
So game consoles, 26 million game consoles were sold in 2006 worldwide.
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:25,840
Actually, a little smaller than you’d think. It’s not such a big market.
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:29,840
Digital cameras dwarfed it at 94 million.
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:36,840
MP3 players, 135 million, and PCs, about 209.
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:42,840
Mobile phones, just about a billion last year worldwide.
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,840
So what does this tell you?
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:50,840
What this tells you is that 1% market share equals 10 million units.
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,840
This is a giant market.
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:57,840
If you just 1% market share, you’re going to sell 10 million phones.
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:03,840
And this is exactly what we’re going to try to do in 2008, our first full year in the market,
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,840
is grab 1% market share and go from there.
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,840
So we’re going to enter a very competitive market, a lot of players.
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,840
We think we’re going to have the best product in the world,
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,840
and we’re going to go for it and see if we can get 1% market share,
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,840
10 million units in 2008, and go from there.
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:32,840
So today we’ve added to the Mac and the iPod, we’ve added Apple TV, and now iPhone.
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:40,840
And you know, the Mac is the only one that you really think of as a computer, right?
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,840
And so we thought about this and we thought, you know,
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,840
maybe our name should reflect this a little bit more than it does.
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:52,840
So we’re announcing today we’re dropping the computer from our name,
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:56,840
and from this day forward we’re going to be known as Apple Incorporated
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,840
to reflect the product mix that we have today.
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:12,840
You know, I didn’t sleep a wink last night, and I was so excited about today
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,840
because we’ve been so lucky at Apple.
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,840
We’ve had some real revolutionary products.
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:23,840
The Mac in 1984 is an experience that those of us that were there will never forget,
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,840
and I don’t think the world will forget it either.
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:31,840
The iPod in 2001 changed everything about music,
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,840
and we’re going to do it again with the iPhone in 2007.
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,840
We’re very excited about this.
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:47,840
There’s an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love.
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,840
I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:58,840
And we’ve always tried to do that at Apple since the very, very beginning,
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,840
and we always will.
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,840
So thank you very, very much for being a part of this.
